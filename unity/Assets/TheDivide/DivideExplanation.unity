      value: "This game is based on the ham-sandwich theorem. This theorem states
        that if there are n measurable objects in an n dimensional space, then there
        is one (n-1)-dimensional slice that cuts them all in half.\r\n\r\nThe characters
        in this game are a random distribution of points. They belong to different
        categories, corresponding to the different classes (i.e. mage, solder or archer),
        and are guaranteed to have a solution (i.e. a possible cut exists).\r\n\r\nAfter
        the initial distribution of points, the algorithm swaps a few points from
        varying categories around to make the solution harder to find. After that,
        it is up to the player make the ham-sandwich cut, which might require the
        player to perform a few swaps first in order to create a composition of three
        classes that can be separated in half with a single cut.\r\n\r\nThe short
        version:\r\n\r\nThe player\u2019s performance is measured by detecting how
        many different point sets the player successfully cut in half. For each point
        set, the algorithm computes the area in which all possible cuts can be made.
        Placing a cut within this area would successfully divide that particular point
        set in half. To find the cut(s) that divide(s) the point sets from all categories
        in half, the algorithm finds the intersection between the areas in which cuts
        can be placed for each point set. Placing a cut within this intersection area
        would successfully divide all point sets from different categories in half.\r\n\r\nThe
        long version:\r\n\r\nThe ham-sandwich cut area for each of the different point
        sets is computed by considering the distribution of each pointset as a primal
        graph, which can be dualized to obtain a graph containing lines. Dualizing
        a graph turns points (P_x,P_y) into lines\r\ny = P_x*x-P_y and vice versa.
        It can be seen that if a point intersects a line in the prime graph, then
        the dual-line from that point will go trough the dual-point of that line in
        the dual graph.\r\n\r\nUsing this property of duality, observe that - for
        each point set - if all dual-lines intersect at a point, then the dual of
        that point is a line that goes trough all those points.\r\n\r\nFurthermore
        the duality transform persevere vertical ordering. That is if a line was above
        and below one point then in the dual it will be a point that is above and
        below a line.\r\n\r\nSo to divide a pointset in the primal plane in two equal
        parts with a line we need to find a point in the dual plane that lies above
        as many lines as below. All such points form a series of convex polygons in
        the dual plane. In the following text, these areas are referred to as viable-cut
        areas.\r\n\r\nThis problem repeats itself for every pointset (e.g. archers
        or mages). The underlying algorithm uses this concept to find possible cuts
        for individual or combined pointsets.\r\n\r\nWhen overlapping the viable cut
        areas from each point set, the intersection of them is the area in which a
        cut can be made that successfully divide all sets of objects in half. This
        area is shown to the player (in a primal version) when he presses Q,W,E or
        R."
